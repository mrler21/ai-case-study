They have partnered with OpenAI to develop models for the next generation of humanoid robot
* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Electromechanical humanoid hardware and openAI’s ChatGPT for the software
## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
General purpose humanoid robots
* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Large companies are beginning to invest in technology that will reduce their dependency on human operators. 
* What are the other major companies in this field?
Nvidia, Disney, Boston Dynamics, and Microsoft
## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
They have developed their prototype humanoid robot by the name of Figure 01
* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
How well the robot is able to interpret audible instructions from a human and translate the instructions into actions. Due to the integration with OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Figure 01 is leading the industry from the demonstrations I have seen.

Industry leading
## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
An affordable robot that they would initially take a loss on but doing so would allow them to get an early monopoly on the market and incorporate the masses into their “ecosystem”. Another option to get a leg  up on the competition would be AGI, but the ball is in OpenAi’s court with that. 
* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
The largest hurdle for mass integration of humanoid robots in society is cost at this point. 
* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
One option would just require a different perspective on business operation. The other would require large jumps in the field of AI.
